Mealpler is the easiest meal planning manager. This app is developed to optimize a routine work of planning food. I find it really useless to figure out how much gramms of rice do I need to cook the dinner. I just keep in mind PORTIONS. So do this app - it allows you to concentrate on the thing that really matters - portion.
